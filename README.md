# California Housing Predict Model

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning model to predict housing prices in California. The model is trained on the California Housing dataset and aims to provide accurate price predictions based on various features such as location, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes.

## Installation
To use this model, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yann-fk-21/california_housing_predict_model.git
   cd california_housing_predict_model
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To train and test the model, run the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
You can modify the script to provide different input data or adjust the model parameters.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for training.
- **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model on the California Housing dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics.
- **Prediction:** Make predictions on new data.
